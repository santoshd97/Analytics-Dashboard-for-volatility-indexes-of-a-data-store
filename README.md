# Analytics-Dashboard-for-volatility-indexes-of-data-store
Created an **analytics dashboard** (project of a visualization course) using **Plotly** to understand which **data elements in a data store are valuable, redundant, sparsely available** by implementing **K-means clustering** algorithm on **supply & demand volatility indexes** with **relation to revenue (color coded) over time**.
Detailed information about this is given in <a href="https://github.com/santoshd97/Analytics-Dashboard-for-volatility-indexes-of-a-data-store/blob/master/report.pdf">report.pdf</a>
